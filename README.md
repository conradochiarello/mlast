Machine Learning Aided Slug Tracking algorithm

Physics-Informed Machine Learning Matlab Algorithm

This algorithm takes as inputs the results of slug tracking algorithm simulations and calibrates the model based on experimental data under identical conditions.

A comparison between a simple model, a pure machine learning model and a hybrid physics/ML model is given. The simple model takes fewer inputs, the pure model takes all the inputs except the model estimate and the hybrid model takes into account everything, physics model included.
